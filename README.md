A utility to visualize models.

Main idea:
* Use this library to attach a learner and initialize a proxy server.
* Connect a javascript client via `todo repo`.
* Send back and forth relevant information to be visualized.

This will allow to use tools like d3, react and threejs to visualize NN information.

## Install

TODO `pip install your_project_name`

## How to use

```python
# TODO
```
