# Fast Explorer
> Work in progress


A utility to visualize models.

Main idea:
* Use this library to attach a learner and initialize a proxy server.
* Connect a javascript client via [fastexplorer-js](https://github.com/renato145/fastexplorer-js).
* Send back and forth relevant information to be visualized.

This will allow to use tools like d3, react and threejs to visualize NN information.
